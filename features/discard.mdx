## Overview

Defer allows you to automatically cancel an execution if it hasn't been
processed within a set time frame. Executions set to be discarded must start
before discard time and can run as long they want. This is useful, for example,
if you want to avoid sending expired 2FA codes to your customers.

You can configure the discard option of a function with a specific datetime or a
duration.

<CodeGroup>

```js duration
const withDiscard = assignOptions(myFunc, { discardAfter: "1h" });
```

```ts datetime
const withDiscard = assignOptions(myFunc, { discardAfter: new Date("1/1/24") });
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Warning>

There could be a conflict between the discard and
[delay options](/features/delays). For instance, if you choose to discard an
execution after 5 minutes but have also delayed it for 1 hour, the execution
will be discarded. To avoid this conflict, you should set the discard option for
1 hour and 5 minutes.

</Warning>

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```ts index.ts
import { assignOptions } from "@defer/client";
import send2FACode from "./defer/send2FACode";

const discardableSend2FACode = assignOptions(send2FACode, {
  discardAfter: "5m",
});
await discardableSend2FACode(userId);
```

```ts defer/send2FACode.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function send2FACode(userId: number) {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer(send2FACode);
```

</CodeGroup>
