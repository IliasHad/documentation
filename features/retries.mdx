## Overview

A job can fail for multiple reasons, such as network outage or bugs. That's why
Defer allows you to set up automatic retries for failed executions.

Before deep diving in the different retry strategies, it is important to
understand the concept of idempotency.
[Idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) means that a job can be
safely executed multiple times, which is crucial since a job may be
half-processed, throw an error, and then be re-executed repeatedly.

In general you can consider your function idempotent if:

- it can safely run multiple times with the same arguments
- side effects are expected to happen only once

Defer allows you to configure two types of retry strategies: the exponential
backoff strategy and the linear retry strategy.

### Exponential backoff

In a backoff retry strategy, the system increases the delay between consecutive
retries after each attempt. The delay is increasing exponentially. This approach
helps prevent overwhelming the service with too many retries in quick
succession, and it gives the service more time to recover from transient issues.

### Linear

In a linear retry strategy, the system retries the operation with a consistent
delay between attempts. For example, the system might retry the operation with a
interval of 5 seconds between each attempts.

## Choosing the right strategy

Here is a simple diagram to assist you in deciding which strategy to apply.

## Configuration

The retry behavior is set up using the following key.

| Field                 | Type      | Default | Description                                                                |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxAttempts`         | `Integer` | 0       | How many retries should we attempt in total                                |
| `initialInterval`     | `Integer` | 30      | How close the first retry should be? (in seconds)                          |
| `randomizationFactor` | `Float`   | 0.5     | How much randomness should be introduced in the space between retries.     |
| `multiplier`          | `Float`   | 1.5     | How fast the space between each retry should grow? (exponential back-off). |
| `maxInterval`         | `Integer` | 600     | What should be the max space between 2 retries? (in seconds)               |

## Examples

<CodeGroup>

```ts default
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function sendEmail(endpoint: string, data: any) {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer(sendEmail, { retry: true });
```

```ts exponential
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function sendWebhook(endpoint: string, data: any) {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer(sendWebhook, {
  retry: {
    maxAttempts: 5,
    initialInterval: 30,
    randomizationFactor: 0.5,
    multiplier: 1.5,
    maxInterval: 600,
  },
});
```

```ts linear
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function fetchRepositoryCommit(repoOwner: string, repoName: string) {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer(fetchRepositoryCommit, {
  retry: {
    maxAttempts: 7,
    initialInterval: 30,
    randomizationFactor: 0,
    multiplier: 1,
    maxInterval: 30,
  },
});
```
