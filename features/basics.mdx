## Overview

A background job is a task or process that runs independently of the main
program, typically running in the background without user interaction. It allows
you to scale your application by performing work in the background.

Creating a background job in Defer is as simple as wrapping your existing code
with the Defer client.

```ts myJob.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function myJob() {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer(myJob);
```

## Conventions

Your function must adhere to the conventions below to be considered a valid
background function.

- The function must be located in the `defer/` folder to be built by the
  [Defer Builder](/platform/builder/overview).
- The function must be a `named` function. The function must be named uniquely
  across all Defer functions (this is a limitation on our end and will be
  resolved in the future).
- The function must return a `Promise`.
- The function must be the `default` export (this is a limitation on our end and
  will be resolved in the future).
- The function must only use JSON serializable arguments. This means that your
  arguments must be simple JSON datatypes such as `numbers`, `strings`,
  `boolean`, `arrays`, and `objects`. Complex JavaScript objects like `Date`,
  `RegExp`, `Class`, etc. will not be serialized.
