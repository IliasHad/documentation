title: "Concurrency"
description: "Control the number of parallel executions"
---

## Overview

Limiting the maximum number of parallel executions is a common practice. For
instance, when third-party services restrict the number of concurrent calls to
their service. This also helps distributing the global concurrency limit into
function limits, preventing one function from consuming all the concurrency.

<Info>

By default, concurrency limit is not configured on background function.

## Examples

<CodeGroup>

```ts FIFO
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function reIndexElasticRecords() {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer(reIndexElasticRecords, { concurrency: 1 });
```

```ts Concurrent
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function importCurrencyRates() {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer(importCurrencyRates, { concurrency: 5 });
```
