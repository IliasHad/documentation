description: "Schedule an execution for later"

## Overview

Defer allows you to schedule the time at which a execution will be executed.
This is useful for example if you want send to a user an email 1 day after they
sign up.

You can schedule a job in the future by using the `delay` function with a
specific datetime or duration.

<CodeGroup>

```ts datetime
const delayFunc = assignOptions(myFunc, { delay: new Date("1/1/24") });
```

```ts duration
const delayFunc = assignOptions(myFunc, { delay: "1h" });
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Info>

The Defer scheduler only works with UTC datetime, so all datetime will be
converted to UTC. For example if you delay something to 1 hour later, it will be
align with your current timezone.

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```ts index.ts
import { assignOptions } from "@defer/client";
import sendOnboardingEmail from "./defer/sendOnboardingEmail";

const delayedSendOnboardingEmail = assignOptions(sendOnboardingEmail, {
  delay: "1h",
});
await delayedSendOnboardingEmail(userId);
```

```ts defer/sendOnboardingEmail.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function sendOnboardingEmail(userId: number) {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer(sendOnboardingEmail);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Console

Even if the execution is scheduled for later you can still see it on the Console
under the "Execution" tab.
