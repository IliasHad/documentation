## Overview

Defer allows you to schedule recurring executions. This is useful for example
when you have a weekly newsletter to send to your users every Monday.

<Tip>
  Even if your defer function is declared as a cron, you can still enqueue it
  anytime at your discretion, like a regular defer function.
</Tip>

You can schedule a recurring execution using the `defer.cron()` function rather
than `defer`.

```ts
export default defer.cron(myFunc, "* * * * *");
```

<Warning>

With Defer CRON your schedule is defined in UTC.

</Warning>

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```ts CRON
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function sendMondayNewletter() {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer.cron(sendMondayNewletter, "0 0 * * MON");
```

```ts Non stackable CRON
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function syncSalesforceContacts() {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer.cron(
  syncSalesforceContacts,
  "*/10 * * * *",
  // Ensure only one CRON is running at a time,
  // and cancel those queued during that time
  {
    concurrency: 1,
    maxConcurrencyAction: "cancel",
  },
);
```

<Tip>

If you are not an expert of the CRON syntax, no worries! You can use the
[crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) website to build your CRON expression!
