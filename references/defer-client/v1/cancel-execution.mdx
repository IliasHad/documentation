title: "cancelExecution()"
icon: function

The `cancelExecution` function cancels a pending or running execution by its ID.
By default, `cancelExecution` can only cancel pending executions and throws an
error if the execution is already running. The `force` option allows for the
cancellation of a running execution.

<CodeGroup>

```ts Cancel Execution
import { cancelExecution } from "@defer/client";
import { sayHello } from "./defer/sayHello";

const { id } = await sayHello("John Doe");
await cancelExecution(id);
```

```ts Abort Execution
import { cancelExecution } from "@defer/client";
import { sayHello } from "./defer/sayHello";

const { id } = await sayHello("John Doe");
await cancelExecution(id, { force: true });
```

```ts defer/sayHello.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

const sayHello = async (name: string) => console.log(`hello ${name}!`);

export default defer(sayHello);
```
