description: A comprehensive breakdown of all errors thrown by @defer/client.
---

A Background Function invocation might throw some catchable errors:

- `DeferError`: any error that happened on the Defer Platform (during an
  execution)
- `ClientError`: any error that happened within `@defer/client` (from your
  application)
- `HTTPRequestError`: any error related to the Defer being unreachable
- `APIError`: any error returned from the
  [Defer API](/references/defer-api/enqueue)

## An error is thrown, what should I do?

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="I got a `DeferError`">

        Any `DeferError` could be resolved by looking into the Defer Console:
        - `"cannot serialize function return: ..."`: your background function is returning a non-serializable value
        - `"Defer execution failed`"`: refer to your execution's logs

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I got a `ClientError`">

        - `"cannot decode http response: xxx"`: please check our [status page](https://status.defer.run/) or [Contact us](mailto:support@defer.run).
        - `"cannot decode http response body:: xxx"`: please check our [status page](https://status.defer.run/) or [Contact us](mailto:support@defer.run).
        - `"unexpected xxx response code"`: please check our [status page](https://status.defer.run/) or [Contact us](mailto:support@defer.run).
