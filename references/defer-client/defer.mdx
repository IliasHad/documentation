icon: function

The `defer(fn, options)` function transforms a named function into a background
function.

Example:

```ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

const sayHello = async (name: string) => console.log(`hello ${name}!`);

export default defer(sayHello);
```

## Options

<ResponseField name="retry" type="boolean | integer | object">
  Determines what happens when this function fails. By default, `retry` is false, meaning the scheduler won't re-execute the function.

When set to `true` the default configuration is applied:

```js
{
 maxAttempts: 13,
 initialInterval: 30,
 randomizationFactor: 0.5,
 multiplier: 1.5,
 maxInterval: 60 * 10,
}
```

When set to 'integer' (e.g. 3), the default configuration is applied but with a
custom maxAttempts:

```js
{
 maxAttempts: 3,
 initialInterval: 30,
 randomizationFactor: 0.5,
 multiplier: 1.5,
 maxInterval: 60 * 10,
}
```

When set to "object", the specified configuration is applied. The object is
defined as follows:

- `maxAttempts`: How many retries should we attempt in total.
- `initialInterval`: How close the first retry should be? (in seconds).
- `randomizationFactor`: How much randomness should be introduced in the space
  between retries.
- `multiplier`: How fast the space between each retry should grow? (exponential
  back-off).
- `maxInterval`: What should be the max space between 2 retries? (in seconds).

Examples:

  <CodeGroup>
  ```js Default
  export default defer(sayHello, { retry: true });
  ```

```js Maximum
export default defer(sayHello, { retry: 10 });
```

```ts Custom
export default defer(sayHello, {
  retry: {
    maxAttempts: 0,
    initialInterval: 30,
    randomizationFactor: 0.5,
    multiplier: 1.5,
    maxInterval: 60 * 10,
  },
});
```

  </CodeGroup>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="concurrency" type="integer">
  Determines the maximum number of parallel executions that are allowed for this function. There is no limit on concurrency by default.

Examples:

  <CodeGroup>
  ```js FIFO
  export default defer(sayHello, { concurrency: 1 });
  ```

```js 5 parallels
export default defer(sayHello, { concurrency: 5 });
```

  </CodeGroup>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="maxDuration" type="integer">
  Determines the maximum allowed execution duration in second for this function, with a default of 30 minutes.

Examples:

  <CodeGroup>
  ```ts 5 minutes
  export default defer(sayHello, { maxDuration: 5 * 60 });
  ```

```ts 3 hours
export default defer(sayHello, { maxDuration: 3 * 60 * 60 });
```

  </CodeGroup>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="maxConcurrencyAction" type={`"cancel" | "keep"`}>
  Determines the action to take on next execution in queue when the concurrency limit is already reached for the function (i.e. N executions are running, where N is the concurrency of the function).

{" "}
<Info>Available starting version `1.15.0`</Info>

  <Expandable title="Actions">
    {" "}
    <ResponseField name="cancel">
      When concurrency limit is reached, will cancel the next queued execution(s) as
      long as concurrency limit is reached.
    </ResponseField>

    {" "}
    <ResponseField name="keep">
      Default behavior. When concurrency limit is reached, will keep the next queued
      execution(s).
    </ResponseField>

  </Expandable>

Examples:

  <CodeGroup>
  ```js FIFO cancel
  export default defer(sayHello, { concurrency: 1, maxConcurrencyAction: 'cancel' });
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
</ResponseField>
