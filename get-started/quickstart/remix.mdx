## Setup

<Snippet file="install-defer-client.mdx" />

### Create a `defer/` folder

Defer expects to find all the background functions in the `defer/` folder.

In a Remix, we recommend creating a `defer/` folder as follows:

```diff
 .
 |-- app/
+|   |-- defer/
 |   |-- entry.client.tsx
 |   |-- entry.server.tsx
 |   |-- root.tsx
 |   |-- routes/
 |-- build/
 |   |-- index.js
 |   |-- index.js.map
 |-- package-lock.json
 |-- package.json
 |-- public/
 |-- remix.config.js
 |-- remix.env.d.ts
 `-- tsconfig.json
```

<Note>

**Important**

**All files inside the `defer/` folder must be Background Functions** (wrapped
with `defer()`); any shared code (ex: utils) should be moved outside of the
`defer/` folder.

The `defer/` folder can be placed anywhere in your project and can contain
nested sub-folders.

</Note>

### Write a background function

A background function is a function equivalent to a background job.

All background functions must live in the `defer/` folder.

Choose how to write your first background function:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title={"Start with the helloWorld() demo function"}>

Let's add the following `helloWorld.ts` function in your `defer/` folder, as
follows:

```ts app/defer/helloWorld.ts
// the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

// a background function must be `async`
async function helloWorld(name: string) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
      resolve("done");
    }, 5000);
  });
}

// the function must be wrapped with `defer()` and exported as default
export default defer(syncContacts);
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={"I got a use case: a new feature or slow code to move in the background"}>

You already have a use case? Sounds great!

Start by first creating a background function in the `defer/` folder and see how
to implement it depending on your use case:

<Tabs>

  <Tab title='Move existing slow code to a background function'>

    ```ts app/defer/syncContacts.ts
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import { defer } from "@defer/client"
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import syncContacts from "../utils/syncContacts"

    // the imported function must be wrapped with `defer()` and re-exported as default
    export default defer(syncContacts)
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title='Write a new feature, ex: syncContacts()'>

    ```ts app/defer/syncContacts.ts
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import { defer } from "@defer/client"

    interface Contact { /* ... */ }

    // a background function must be `async`
    async function syncContacts(contacts: Contact) {
      // ...
    }

    // the function must be wrapped with `defer()` and exported as default
    export default defer(helloWorld)
    ```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

Our background function is ready to be used; let's see how to call it from your
application.

### Call your background function

Whenever you choose to use the `helloWorld()` function or create your own, the
following example showcasing how to call `helloWorld()`, from a Remix
`/hello-world` route, demonstrates how easily you can trigger a background
function execution.

```ts remix/app/routes/helloWorld.ts
import type { LoaderArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import helloWorld from "~/defer/helloWorld";

export async function loader({ params }: LoaderArgs) {
  await helloWorld();
  return new Response("OK.", {
    status: 200,
  });
}
```

<Tip>
**How does Defer work?**

If you are wondering how calling a background function triggers an execution on
Defer, please refer to this guide: [How Defer works](/get-started/concepts).

</Tip>

Once your Remix Controller route is defined, please commit and push it to your
branch.

Now that your Remix app contains a background function and an API route that
calls it, let's ensure that your Defer token is configured correctly.

<Snippet file="setup-runtime.mdx" />

## Configure

<Snippet file="setup-defer-app.mdx" />

<Snippet file="api-deployment-configuration.mdx" />

## Deploy

Now, with your API deployment containing your Defer Token and your project's
builds ready on Defer, open your browser and test the Remix Controller route.

In the scenario of the `helloWorld()` background function, visit the `/hello`
route.

You should see that your API answered quickly, and by going to your
[Defer Console](https://console.defer.run/), you should see that your background
function has 1 execution running - or finished:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/getting-started/functions-list.png"
    alt="Your first function on the Defer Console"
    width={800}
    height={900}
  />
</Frame>

By clicking on see executions, you will access the executions list:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/getting-started/function-runs.png"
    alt="Your first successful function un on the Defer Console"
    width={800}
    height={900}
  />
</Frame>
