## Setup

<Snippet file="install-defer-client.mdx" />

### Create a `defer/` folder

Defer expects to find all the background functions in the `defer/` folder.

In a Nest app, we recommend creating a `defer/` folder as follows:

```diff
 .
 |-- nest-cli.json
 |-- package.json
 |-- src/
 |   |-- app.controller.spec.ts
 |   |-- app.controller.ts
 |   |-- app.module.ts
 |   |-- app.service.ts
+|   |-- defer/
 |   |-- main.ts
 |-- tsconfig.build.json
 |-- tsconfig.json
 |-- yarn.lock
```

<Note>

**Important**

**All files inside the `defer/` folder must be Background Functions** (wrapped
with `defer()`); any shared code (ex: utils) should be moved outside of the
`defer/` folder.

The `defer/` folder can be placed anywhere in your project and can contain
nested sub-folders.

</Note>

### Write a background function

A background function is a function equivalent to a background job.

All background functions must live in the `defer/` folder.

Choose how to write your first background function:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title={"Start with the helloWorld() demo function"}>

Let's add the following `helloWorld.ts` function in your `defer/` folder, as
follows:

```ts src/defer/helloWorld.ts
// the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

// a background function must be `async`
async function helloWorld(name: string) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
      resolve("done");
    }, 5000);
  });
}

// the function must be wrapped with `defer()` and exported as default
export default defer(helloWorld);
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={"I got a use case: a new feature or slow code to move in the background"}>

You already have a use case? Sounds great!

Start by first creating a background function in the `defer/` folder and see how
to implement it depending on your use case:

<Tabs items={['Move existing existing slow code to a background function', 'Write a new feature, ex: syncContacts()']}>

  <Tab>

    ```ts src/defer/syncContacts.ts
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import { defer } from "@defer/client"
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import syncContacts from "../utils/syncContacts"

    // the imported function must be wrapped with `defer()` and re-exported as default
    export default defer(syncContacts)
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

    ```ts src/defer/syncContacts.ts
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import { defer } from "@defer/client"

    interface Contact { /* ... */ }

    // a background function must be `async`
    async function syncContacts(contacts: Contact) {
      // ...
    }

    // the function must be wrapped with `defer()` and exported as default
    export default defer(syncContacts)
    ```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

Our background function is ready to be used; let's see how to call it from your
application.

### Sidenote: How to use your Nest Services

Using Nest Services from background functions requires some minor plumbing work
since background functions behave as what Nest calls
["Standalone app"](https://docs.nestjs.com/standalone-applications).

For example, your Nest application relies on a standard `PrismaService`:

```ts src/prisma.service.ts
import { Injectable, OnModuleInit } from "@nestjs/common";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

@Injectable()
export class PrismaService extends PrismaClient implements OnModuleInit {
  async onModuleInit() {
    await this.$connect();
  }
}
```

which you can use from your `src/defer/syncContacts.ts` background function as
follows:

```ts src/defer/syncContacts.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";

import { AppModule } from "src/app.module";
import { PrismaService } from "src/prisma.service";

const getPrismaInstance = async () => {
  const app = await NestFactory.createApplicationContext(AppModule);
  await app.init();
  return app.get(PrismaService);
};

const syncContacts = async () => {
  const prisma = getPrismaInstance();

  // TODO: use Prisma
};

export default defer(syncContacts);
```

The `getPrismaInstance()` initializes a Nest Application context that will
initiate the Services with your application configuration.

The same pattern can be applied to retrieve the Nest application logger,
configuration, and other injectable elements.

### Call your background function

Whenever you choose to use the `helloWorld()` function or create your own, the
following example showcasing how to call `helloWorld()` from a Nest Controller
demonstrates how easily you can trigger a background function execution.

```ts src/app.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AppService } from "./app.service";
import helloWorld from "./defer/helloWorld";

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get()
  async getHello(): Promise<string> {
    await helloWorld();
    return this.appService.getHello();
  }
}
```

<Tip>
**How does Defer work?**

If you are wondering how calling a background function triggers an execution on
Defer, please refer to this guide: [How Defer works](/get-started/concepts).

</Tip>

Once your Nest Controller route is defined, please commit and push it to your
branch.

Now that your Nest app contains a background function and an API route that
calls it, let's ensure that your Defer token is configured correctly.

<Snippet file="setup-runtime.mdx" />

## Configure

<Snippet file="setup-defer-app.mdx" />

<Snippet file="api-deployment-configuration.mdx" />

## Deploy

Now, with your API deployment containing your Defer Token and your project's
builds ready on Defer, open your browser and test the Nest Controller route.

In the `helloWorld()` background function scenario, visit the `/` route.

You should see that your API answered quickly, and by going to your
[Defer Console](https://console.defer.run/), you should see that your background
function has 1 execution running - or finished:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/getting-started/functions-list.png"
    alt="Your first function on the Defer Console"
  />
</Frame>

By clicking on see executions, you will access the executions list:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/getting-started/function-runs.png"
    alt="Your first successful function un on the Defer Console"
  />
</Frame>
