## Local Development

The good news is that Defer works locally by default; without a specific
command.

**How?**

Locally, background functions run in the background leveraging the
[Promise API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise),
providing a behavior similar to production environments, with some limitations.

<Warning>
  We don't recommend setting a `DEFER_TOKEN` locally. By doing so, all calls to
  your background functions will run on the Defer Platform, preventing you from
  debugging locally.
</Warning>

### Development Limitations

Defer relies on the
[Promise API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
to execute background functions locally; it means that all executions are bound
to the parent process and will be canceled if the parent process (ex: local
server) crashed or is stopped.

`@defer/client` supports the following feature locally:

### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I debug my background functions without the Defer Console?">
    Locally, background functions get executed on your machine using the JavaScript
    Promise API.

    Local executions won't appear on your Defer Dashboard; however, all logs printed
    by your background functions will show in your local API server terminal.

    Similarly, when executed locally, background functions can benefit from any
    [Node.js breakpoints](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I set a `DEFER_TOKEN` locally?">
    We don't recommend doing it.

    By setting a `DEFER_TOKEN` locally, all calls to your background functions will
    run on the Defer Platform.

    It will result in executing the version of your background function present on
    GitHub, not locally, which can be confusing.
