## Suggested resolutions steps

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="1. Does your application has one successful build?">

A Defer application needs a successful build to accept executions.

Double-check that your Defer application has at least one successful build.
Otherwise, we won't be able to process your executions.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="2. Did you reach your concurrency limit?">

    Each account gets a maximum limit applied across all applications and environments:

    - Free plan: `2` concurrent executions
    - Growth plan: `10` concurrent executions (or custom)

    Check all your applications and environments for running executions; if no executions are running, please refer to the next step.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="3. Too many executions 'Running'?">

    Workflows, especially on the Free plan -- with a concurrency limit of `2`, can lead to a _deadlock_ situation when a parent execution is waiting on a stuck child execution, exhausting the concurrency limit.

    To resolve such an issue, wait for the child execution to timeout (30min) and consider upgrading to a Growth plan, which is better suited for workflows.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="4. Check status.defer.run">

    We might be facing some processing slow-down or outage.

    Please check on [status.defer.run](https://status.defer.run) and subscribe for future updates to be informed of the resolution.
