Scraping the web with Node.js is resource-intensive. It is also
[nearly impossible](https://gist.github.com/kettanaito/56861aff96e6debc575d522dd03e5725)
to achieve on a Serverless platform such as Vercel. Likewise, using a large
framework like Playwright is overkill for such a common and essentially simple
idea.

Defer, by providing native Puppeteer support, makes it easy to implement
scraping use cases. You can also control your scraping jobs with Defer Console.

## The code â€” Wrap Puppeteer as a Defer function

Below, we show you how to use Defer to implement a popular use case: generating
thumbnail images from user-provided links with only a few lines of code.

```tsx src/defer/generateLinkThumbnail.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";

const generateLinkThumbnail = async (url: string) => {
  // make sure to pass the `--no-sandbox` option
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ args: ["--no-sandbox"] });

  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // pass the following `waitUntil` option to avoid
  //   unnecessary blocking when loading a page
  await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: "networkidle0" });

  // perform some actions...

  // any file must be store in the local `/workspace/` folder
  await page.screenshot({ path: "/workspace/screenshot.jpg" });

  // save the screenshot to an external storage (e.g., S3)...

  await browser.close();
};

export default defer(generateLinkThumbnail, {
  retry: 5, // adding retry in case of flakiness issues
});
```

This is a standard Defer pattern:

- Wrap the functionality in a function. Here, the function
  `generateLinkThumbnail()` performs all the scraping and thumbnail logic.
- Use the Defer client (`defer`) to call the wrapping function and trigger an
  execution in the background. This is done in the last line of the above code.

## Monitoring Defer and Puppeteer

With Defer Console, you can monitor your scraping function. Puppeteer can run
for multiple hours:

Finally, Defer Console notifies you in case of delays or failures. By providing
job details, the Console allows you to abort the stuck executions or re-run the
failed ones:
