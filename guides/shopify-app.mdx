  "Leverage Defer to integrate with the Shopify API and Shopify Webhooks"
---

The e-commerce platform Shopify enables merchants to build their stores with no
code knowledge. It is also extensible: developers can build Shopify apps to
integrate their own or third-party APIs—for example, payment services, search
and navigation tools, and product translation apps.

## Shopify apps

[Shopify apps](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps) are standalone Node.js or Ruby
apps that integrate with Shopify's API. Most Shopify apps rely on
[Shopify Webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2023-10/resources/webhook)
and other data export APIs.

This is where Defer comes in, to help manage activities such as rate limiting,
webhooks processing, and other complex background processes. We'll illustrate
this with an example of a product translation service.

## Use case—Product Translation

Our Shopify app (”Inventory Translator”) is built with
[Shopify's Node.js template](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-node).
It enables merchants to translate their inventory of products and associated
[variants](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/variants).

We use two approaches.

### First Approach: Real-time product updates

We use webhooks to receive regular notifications of new or updated products:

![Shopify app architecture](/images/guides/shopify-app/shopify-app.svg)

When notified, our app retrieves from Shopify the product's data and
[associated meta fields](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields),
such as product localization information (“us-US, fr-FR”). Our app then
translates the properties and updates them with the Shopify API:

![Processing Shopify Webhooks](/images/guides/shopify-app/shopify-webhooks.svg)

As the
[Shopify API is rate-limited](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits),
product updates must be processed in the background to help deal with surges of
updates and rate limits.

```tsx src/api.ts
import express from "express";
import shopify from "./shopifyClient";

import handleProductCreateWebhook from "defer/handleProductCreateWebhook";
import handleProductUpdateWebhook from "defer/handleProductUpdateWebhook";

shopify.webhooks.addHandlers({
  PRODUCTS_CREATE: [
    {
      deliveryMethod: DeliveryMethod.Http,
      callbackUrl: "/webhooks",
      callback: handleProductCreateWebhook,
    },
  ],
  PRODUCTS_UPDATE: [
    {
      deliveryMethod: DeliveryMethod.Http,
      callbackUrl: "/webhooks",
      callback: handleProductUpdateWebhook,
    },
  ],
});

// Process webhooks with body as text (serializable)
app.post("/webhooks", express.text({ type: "*/*" }), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    await shopify.webhooks.process({
      rawBody: req.body, // is a string
      rawRequest: req,
      rawResponse: res,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message);
  }
});
```

```tsx src/defer/handleProductCreateWebhook.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

const handleProductCreateWebhook = async (
  topic: string,
  shop: string,
  webhookRequestBody: string,
  _webhookId: string,
  _apiVersion: string,
) => {
  const session = await getSessionFromStorage(
    shopify.session.getOfflineId(shop),
  );
  const client = new shopify.clients.Graphql({
    session,
    apiVersion: ApiVersion.January23,
  });

  // Then:
  // 1. fetch the product data and metafields
  // 2. translates the data
  // 3. update the product with the Shopify API
};

export default defer(handleProductCreateWebhook, {
  retry: 5, // ensure to retry in case of unwanted issues (ex: outage)
  concurrency: 2, // limit the processing to match Shopify API's rate limit
});
```

### Second approach: Process updates every hour with a CRON

Another approach would be to perform product updates every hour. For this, we
implement a CRON to spawn a
[Defer Background Function](https://docs.defer.run/get-started/concepts) for
each shop.

The Defer Background Function triggers a
[Shopify Bulk Query](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/bulk-operations/queries#bulk-query-overview)
to export and translate all the product data. The Bulk Query makes an initial
Shopify API request to ask for the data export, then it pools the returned
`bulkOperation.id` to get the status of the requested export.

```tsx src/defer/reindexShops.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";
import translateShopProducts from "./translateShopProducts.ts";

async function processProducts() {
  shops.forEach((shop) => {
    await translateShopProducts(shop);
  });
}

export default defer.cron(processProducts, "0 * * * *");
```

```tsx src/defer/translateShopProducts.ts
import { defer, delay } from '@defer/client'

const REQUEST_PRODUCTS_BULK_QUERY = `mutation {
  bulkOperationRunQuery(
   query: """
    {
      products {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
          }
        }
      }
    }
    """
  ) {
    bulkOperation {
      id
      status
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}`

const GET_STATUS_QUERY = `
{
  node(id: $id) {
    ... on BulkOperation {
      id
      status
      errorCode
      createdAt
      completedAt
      objectCount
      fileSize
      url
      partialDataUrl
    }
  }
}
`

const translateShopProductsAsync =defer(
	async function translateShopProducts(shop, bulkQueryOperationID) {
	  const session = await getSessionFromStorage(shopify.session.getOfflineId(shop));
	  const client = new shopify.clients.Graphql({
	    session,
	    apiVersion: ApiVersion.January23,
	  });

	  // if we did not initiated the bulk export query, trigger it
	  if (bulkQueryOperationID) {
			const response = await client.query({
			  data: {
			    query: REQUEST_PRODUCTS_BULK_QUERY,
			  },
			});

			// check the status of the export in 1min
			await delayedTranslateShopProductsAsync(shop, response.data.bulkOperationRunQuery.bulkOperation.id)
	  } else {
			const response = await client.query({
			  data: {
			    query: GET_STATUS_QUERY,
					variables: { id: bulkQueryOperationID }
			  },
			});
			if (['CREATED', 'RUNNING'].includes(response.data.node.status) {
				// check the status of the export in 1min
				await delayedTranslateShopProductsAsync(shop, response.data.bulkOperationRunQuery.bulkOperation.id)
			} else {
				// download the `response.data.url` file and process it for translations
			}
	  }

	},
  { concurrency: 10 }
)
const delayedTranslateShopProductsAsync = delay(translateShopProductsAsync, '1min')

export default translateShopProductsAsync
```

`translateShopProducts.ts` is a Recursive Background Function that calls itself
with the extra `bulkQueryOperationID` argument to track the status of the
inventory export.

Once the Bulk Export Query is completed, we download the file and process it to
create translations.
