Background Functions must be able to access and process files used by your
application or API. And yet, being decoupled, the different processes and applications
must find ways to share files.

Additionally, the file-sharing process must be fail-safe,
performant, and avoid access problems.

This guide provides **two solutions** for these requirements: external storage
and passing files as `base64`.

### Defer file processing

You can implement one or both of these approaches using Defer. Defer Functions
live in your application thanks to
[standard conventions](https://docs.defer.run/features/basics#conventions). One
of them is that a Defer Function's arguments and return values must be
serializable, which is needed for the approach that passes a `base64` argument.

## First approach: encode lightweight files with base64

A good first approach for a single lightweight file (\<10MB) is to serialize it
with the `base64` algorithm. For this, you can leverage the Node.js
`Buffer.from()` API.

Here is an example that uploads an image:

```tsx src/api.ts
import express from "express";
import fileUpload from "express-fileupload";
import processFile from "defer/processFile";

const app = express();

app.use(fileUpload());

app.post("/file/upload", (request, response) => {
  if (!req.files || Object.keys(req.files).length === 0) {
    return res.status(400).send("No files were uploaded.");
  }

  // The name of the input field (i.e. "uploadedFile") is used to retrieve the uploaded file
  const file = req.files.uploadedFile;
  await processFile(Buffer.from(file).toString("base64"));
});

export default app;
```

```tsx src/defer/processFile.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function processFile(imageSource: string) {
  const file = Buffer.from(imageSource.split(";base64,").pop()!, "base64");

  // `file` can now be used with `sharp` for image processing
}

export default defer(processFile);
```

## Second approach: store files temporarily on an external storage

Another approach, better suited for handling multiple file types (e.g., images
and pdf) or large files (>10 MB), is to upload the file to external storage
(e.g., [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/sdk-for-javascript/) or
[Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob)). Then, the Defer
Function can retrieve the file independently from the external storage when
executed.

```tsx src/api.ts
import express from "express";
import fileUpload from "express-fileupload";
import processFile from "defer/processFile";
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import s3Config from "./s3Config";

const s3Client = new S3Client(s3Config);

const app = express();

app.use(fileUpload());

app.post("/file/upload", (request, response) => {
  if (!req.files || Object.keys(req.files).length === 0) {
    return res.status(400).send("No files were uploaded.");
  }

  // The name of the input field (i.e. "uploadedFile") is used to retrieve the uploaded file
  const file = req.files.uploadedFile;

  const bucketParams = {
    Bucket: process.env.AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME,
    Key: `file-upload-${file.name}`,
    Body: file,
  };
  await s3Client.send(new PutObjectCommand(bucketParams));

  await processFile(`file-upload-${file.name}`);
});

export default app;
```

```tsx src/defer/processFile.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";
import { S3Client, GetObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import s3Config from "../s3Config";

const s3Client = new S3Client(s3Config);

async function processFile(fileName: string) {
  const { Body } = await s3Client.send(new GetObjectCommand(bucketParams));
  const fileSource = await Body?.transformToByteArray();
  if (!fileSource) {
    throw new Error("could not parse image source");
  }
  const file = Buffer.from(fileSource.split(";base64,").pop()!, "base64");

  // `file` can now be used as a base64 `Buffer`
}

export default defer(processFile);
```

## Summary

You'll want to use the first approach for passing a single file of less than 10
MB. For larger files or multiple files, you'll be better off with the second
approach.
