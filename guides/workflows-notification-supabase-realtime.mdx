  "Keep your users informed of long-running workflows progress with Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open-source Firebase alternative for
building apps. It offers a real-time database that allows developers to store
and sync data across multiple devices in real-time.

Many application workflows are triggered to run in the background due (with
Defer) to their long-running times. **As many of these are triggered by users,
they require notifications to indicate progress**.

You can use Defer with Supabase to execute long-running background workflows,
leveraging
[Supabase's Realtime Broadcast](https://www.notion.so/Long-running-workflows-with-Supabase-Realtime-37c3830217284ef5b3adf11e51ee5685?pvs=21)
within Defer to send realtime end-user notifications (ex: progress).

## Use case

Supabase Realtime Broadcast is a WebSocket messaging solution. Below is a NextJS
application that shows how to connect an end-user's Social accounts to set up
alerts on selected topics. We use OpenAI to extract topics from the imported
verbatim (e.g., “Nodejs performance”).

### 1. Emit updates from a long-running Workflow

The initial import, performed by `importSocialVerbatim(),` of users' posts and
related searches' posts might take time (e.g., 5 - 15 minutes); for this reason,
`importSocialVerbatim()` sends regular updates to the front end by leveraging
Supabase's Broadcast feature:

```tsx defer/importSocialMessages.ts
import { defer } '@defer/client'

import supabaseClient from '../supabaseClient'
import { importersForUser } from '../importers'
import { classifierForUser } from '../classifier'

async importSocialVerbatim(userID: string) {
   const channelName = `import-socials-${userID}`
   const channel = supabaseClient.channel(channelName)

   const importers = importersForUser(userID)
   for (const importer of importers) {
     // notify the user that we start importing data
     channel.send({
		   type: 'broadcast',
		   event: 'progress',
		   payload: { message: `Importing ${importer.name}...` },
		 })
     await importer.perform()

     // retrieve a classifier that will index the imported data
     //   into a Vector database
     const classifier = classifierForUser(importer.name, userID)
		 channel.send({
		   type: 'broadcast',
		   event: 'progress',
		   payload: { message: `Extracting topics for ${importer.name}...` },
		 })
     await classifier.perform()
   }

   // always close the channel once finished
   supabaseClient.removeChannel(channelName)
}

export default defer(importSocialVerbatim, {
   concurrency: 5 // ensure we don't exceed our 3rd Party API rate limits
})
```

The above code does the following:

1. For a given `userID`, it retrieves the importers for each connected social
   account
2. Then, sequentially, it runs the importer and, once the data is imported, runs
   an OpenAI classifier that creates embedding to later extract major topics
   (e.g., “NodeJS performance”)
3. Finally, once all the data is imported and stored in a Supabase Vector
   database, it closes the broadcast channel

_Note_: this function could be broken down easily into multiple parallel
background functions, sharing the same `channel` to broadcast updates.

### 2.Display real-time updates to the users

Finally, let's add the real-time updates to our front end:

```tsx app/pages/Setup.tsx
"use client";
import importVerbatim from "@/defer/importVerbatim";
import { useDeferRoute } from "@defer/client/next";
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from "react";

import supabaseClient from "../../supabaseClient";
import useUser from "../hooks/useUser";

export default function Setup() {
  const { id: userID } = useUser();
  const subscribed = useRef(false);
  const channelName = `import-socials-${userID}`;

  const [progress, updateProgress] = useState<string>();

  const [startImport, { loading, result }] = useDeferRoute<
    typeof importVerbatim
  >("/api/importVerbatim");

  useEffect(() => {
    if (loading && !subscribed.current) {
      subscribed.current = true;
      supabaseClient
        .channel(channelName)
        .supabaseClient.on("broadcast", { event: "progress" }, (payload) =>
          updateProgress(payload.message),
        )
        .subscribe();
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      {/* JSX UI that will trigger `startImport(userID)` and display `progress`*/}
    </>
  );
}
```

The above code does the following:

1. It creates a `progress` state that will store the received live updates from
   the workflows
2. It instantiates the `useDeferRoute()` hook from `@defer/client/next` to get
   the `startImport()` function to trigger the workflow
3. The `useEffect()` block will start listening for the `importVerbatim`
   execution once started and store the received updates in the `progress` local
   state
