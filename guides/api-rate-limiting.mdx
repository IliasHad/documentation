## Configure concurrency

```ts defer/importContacts.ts
import { defer } from "@defer.run/client";

const importContacts = () => {
  // ...
};
export default defer(importContacts, {
  concurrency: 2,
});
```

## Combine concurrency and retries for API rate limiting

The combination of `retry` and `concurrency` is perfect for fixed API rate
limiting.

For example, an `askOpenAI()` background function is limited to 10 calls per
minute.

Knowing that `askOpenAI()` runs, on average, for 1min, the following
configuration would be perfect to optimize the performance while matching the
OpenAI API rate limits:

```ts defer/importContacts.ts
import { defer } from "@defer.run/client";

const importContacts = () => {
  // ...
};
export default defer(importContacts, {
  concurrency: 10,
  retry: 5,
});
```

The `concurrency` ensures we don't cross the 10 calls per minute with our ~1min
per call. On the other hand, the `retry` option is here to recover some
scenarios where multiple sequential calls would execute under 1min.

Here is an easy rule of thumb to find your perfect `concurrency` value for any
API rate limiting scenario:

> `concurrency = Math.floor(callsMaxPerMinute * AvgDurationInMinutes)`

| `concurrency` | `callsMaxPerMinute` | `AvgDurationInMinutes` |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `10`          | `10`                | `1` (1 min)            |
| `5`           | `10`                | `0.5` (30 secs)        |
| `0`           | `10`                | `0.08` (5 secs)        |

The last line is a perfect example of the limitation of this approach.

Moreover, as many public 3rd party APIs rely on dynamic rate limiting using the
[leaky bucket algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket) and other
algorithms, we will soon roll out a `throttling` option to better configure rate
limiting.
