description: "A useful pattern for long-running GraphQL Mutations"

GraphQL is a widely used query language and API technology. Some GraphQL data
operations, most notably its [Mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/),
may run slowly due to the size of the data, for example, when batch-processing
hundreds of objects or exporting large datasets.

Many platforms have enhanced GraphQL API design using different patterns. For
example, Shopify introduced
[Bulk Operations](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/bulk-operations/queries),
which adds asynchronous patterns **for long-running Mutations**.

Defer replicates Shopify's pattern with its
[scheduling capabilities](https://docs.defer.run/introduction) and
[Public API](https://docs.defer.run/references/defer-client/get-execution).

## Use caseâ€”Large email campaigns

While Shopify's Bulk Operations is built to manage large datasets, our example
shows how to leverage Defer to implement a similar pattern for sending bulk
emails.

A user can trigger an email campaign workflow that runs for 30 minutes.

The application UI will reflect the progress of the workflow; for this, our
GraphQL API will expose a `Mutation` to trigger the `sendCampaign()` workflow
and a `Query` to check its status.

```tsx src/api.ts
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server";
import { getExecution } from "@defer/client";

import sendCampaign from "defer/sendCampaign";
import {
  storeExecutionToWorkfow,
  getExecutionFromWorkflow,
} from "db/workflows";

// The GraphQL schema
const typeDefs = `#graphql
	enum DeferOperationState {
    created,
		running,
		succeed,
		failed,
		aborting,
		aborted,
		cancelled
	}

	type Any

  type DeferOperation {
		id: ID
		state: DeferOperationState
		result: Any
  }

  type Query {
    workflowStatus(workflowID: ID!): DeferOperation
  }

  type Mutation {
    triggerWorkflow(workflowID: ID!): DeferOperation
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    workflowStatus: async (workflowID: string) => {
      const executionID = getExecutionFromWorkflow(workflowID);
      return getExecution(executionID);
    },
  },
  Mutation: {
    triggerWorkflow: async (workflowID: string) => {
      const deferOperation = sendCampaign(workflowID);
      storeExecutionToWorkfow(workflowID, deferOperation.id);
      return deferOperation;
    },
  },
};

// Set up Apollo Server
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});
```

By leveraging the `DeferOperation` GraphQL type and `@defer/client`'s
`getExecution()` helper, we implemented a pattern for long-running Mutations
similar to Shopify's Bulk Operations.
