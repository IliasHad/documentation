Sh#! happens. Errors occur. The network slows down, memory runs out, an external
resource becomes unavailable. Maybe there's a security issue.

Whatever the case may be, an API must be able to clearly identify the error,
catch it, and give you the tools to manage the error—ideally, programmatically
and in real-time.

In this guide, you'll learn how to use Defer to manage the following kinds of
errors:

- Timeouts
- External failures
- Runtime errors
- Internal errors

### Filter executions for a given Error Reason

You can always go to the Defer Console to quickly identify errors that impact
your application. The Defer Console's Error Reason filter allows you to analyze
errors by error type:

<Frame caption="First, select the metadata filter and Error reason">
  <img src="/images/guides/handling-errors/1.png" alt="Error reason filter" />
</Frame>

<br />

<Frame caption="Finally, select Error reason">
  <img src="/images/guides/handling-errors/2.png" alt="Error reason" />
</Frame>

<br />

<Frame caption="You can now inspect executions for the select Error reason">
  <img src="/images/guides/handling-errors/3.png" alt="Filtered executions" />
</Frame>

## How **to handle timeouts**

Unwanted timeouts due to external factors, such as network or 3rd party API
outages, can compromise your concurrency capabilities. Here are two patterns
that mitigate timeouts:

### **1 - Timeout control with the `maxDuration` option**

Since
[`@defer/client@1.6.0`](https://github.com/defer-run/defer.client/releases/tag/v1.6.0),
you can specify a `maxDuration` to avoid unwanted timeouts.

```tsx
const importContacts = (companyId: string, contacts: Contact[]) => {
  //  ...
};

export default defer(importContacts, {
  maxDuration: 10, // will timeout after 10secs
});
```

### 2 - **Canceling executions**

Since
[`@defer/client@1.8.0`](https://www.notion.so/Narrow-down-Error-Causes-with-the-Defer-Console-dba3d73ed50d4a55951c763dc10014f0?pvs=21),
you can also cancel pending executions from the API.

```tsx
import { cancelExecution } from "@defer/client";

// ...

const { id } = await cancelExecution(executionId);

// ...
```

**_Note: You can also cancel pending and running executions from the Defer
Console._**

## How **to handle runtime and external errors**

_External errors_ are linked to 3rd party API outages or network issues, while
_runtime errors_ range from typos and malformed data to memory issues. Both can
be mitigated with the `retry` option and by enabling Slack notifications.

Here's an overview of Defer's retry capabilities. For a full discussion with use
case and notification examples, please read our
[Deep Dive into Defer's Retry Strategies](https://www.defer.run/blog/function-retry-strategies).

### Standard Retry strategies

Defer defaults to no retry:

```ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function myBgFunction() {
  /* ... */
}

export default defer(myBgFunction);
// is equivalent to:
export default defer(myBgFunction, { retry: false });
```

Adding `{ retry: true }` to your background function will enable the retry
option, which defaults up to 13 retries.

You can also control the amount of retries by replacing `true` with a number,
such as `{ retry: 5 }`.

```ts
export default defer(myBgFunction, { retry: 5 });
```

The `retry` combined with `concurrency` is a simple way to deal with API
rate-limiting.

For example, the below function—running for 500ms—will ensure that the 3rd party
API will be called only once per second:

```ts
export default defer(myBgFunction, {
  retry: 5,
  concurrency: 2,
});
```

The `{ retry: false }`, `{ retry: true }`, `{ retry: 5 }` are shorthands to
disable or configure retries.

However, Defer offers more precise retry strategies.

### Fine-tuning your retry strategy

Defer comes with a number of
[retry parameters](https://docs.defer.run/references/defer-client/defer#options).
The code below shows you the role of each retry option:

```ts
{
   // How many retries should we attempt in total?
   maxAttempts: 3,

   // How close the first retry should be? (in seconds) ?
   initialInterval: 30,

   // How much randomness should be introduced in the space between retries?
   randomizationFactor: 0,5,

   // How fast the space between each retry should grow? (exponential back-off)
   multiplier: 1,5,

   // What should be the max space between 2 retries? (in seconds)
   maxInterval: 600,
}
```

[retry deep dive](https://www.defer.run/blog/function-retry-strategies) for a
full discussion and more use cases.
