**Next.js template available**

This guide comes with a one-click deployable demo
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/defer-run/defer.demo/tree/master/nextjs/resend-template#readme).

</Info>

By combining **Defer** and [Resend](https://resend.com/), send and **schedule
rich-styled emails in minutes**, while keeping full control over their
scheduling with cancellations and the Defer Console.

This guide will show you how to implement a **monthly usage report email with an
attached PDF invoice**:

**Resend**, combined with `@react-pdf/renderer` will help in **sending rich
emails**.

**Defer** will help in **scheduling monthly emails** while respecting **Resend's
API rate limiting and avoiding duplicate sends** .

## Implementing the usage email

### A rich email with JSX

Resend combined with its
[`@react-email/components`](https://react.email/docs/introduction),
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and Defer's support for JSX enables us to
write our monthly usage email with React as follows:

<Accordion title="src/emails/MonthlyUsage.tsx">

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import {
  Body,
  Button,
  Container,
  Head,
  Heading,
  Html,
  Img,
  Preview,
  Section,
  Tailwind,
  Text,
} from "@react-email/components";

interface MonthlyUsageEmailProps {
  firstName: string;
  title: string;
  period: string;
  percentPlan: number;
}

export const MonthlyUsageEmail = ({
  firstName,
  period,
  title,
  percentPlan,
}: MonthlyUsageEmailProps) => {
  return (
    <Html>
      {" "}
      <Head />
      <Preview>{`Your Defer usage for ${period}`}</Preview>{" "}
      <Tailwind>
        <Body className="bg-white my-auto mx-auto font-sans">
          <Container className="border border-solid border-[#eaeaea] rounded my-[40px] mx-auto p-[20px] w-[465px]">
            <Section className="mt-[32px]">
              {" "}
              <Img
                src={"https://www.defer.run/github/defer_lightmode.png"}
                width="250"
                height="131"
                alt="Defer"
                className="my-0 mx-auto"
              />{" "}
            </Section>
            <Heading className="text-black text-[24px] font-normal text-center p-0 my-[30px] mx-0">
              {title}{" "}
            </Heading> <Text className="text-black text-[14px] leading-[24px]">
              Hello {firstName},{" "}
            </Text>
            <Text className="text-black text-[14px] leading-[24px]">

            </Text>
            <Section className="text-center mt-[32px] mb-[32px]">
              {" "}
              <Button
                pX={20}
                pY={12}
                className="bg-[#000000] rounded text-white text-[12px] font-semibold
no-underline text-center"
                href={"#"}
              >
                {" "}
                Go to the Console{" "}
              </Button>{" "}
            </Section>
          </Container>{" "}
        </Body>{" "}
      </Tailwind>{" "}
    </Html>
  );
};

export default MonthlyUsageEmail;
```

</Accordion>

The `<MonthlyUsageEmail />` component is then provided to our
`sendMonthlyUsage()` function (example in a NextJS project):

```ts src/defer/sendMonthlyUsage.tsx
import { Resend } from "resend";
import MonthlyUsageEmail from "@/emails/MonthlyUsage";

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!);

async function sendMonthlyUsage(userId: string) {
  const billingInfo = getBillingInfo(); // ... query DB with `userId`
  const usageInfo = getUsageInfo(); // ... query DB with `userId`

  const title = `You performed ${new Intl.NumberFormat().format(
    usageInfo.executions,
  )} executions in ${billingInfo.period}`;

  await resend.emails.send({
    from: "usage@defer.run",
    to: "charly@defer.run",
    subject: title,
    html: title,
    react: MonthlyUsageEmail({
      firstName: billingInfo.user.firstName,
      title,
      percentPlan: usageInfo.planPercent,
      period: billingInfo.period,
    }),
  });
}
```

### Attach the PDF to the email

Our monthly usage email comes with a PDF file listing all executions performed
in the given period.

[`@react-pdf/renderer`](https://react-pdf.org/), similarly to
`@react-email/components` enable us to create a PDF file using React components,
as follows:

```diff src/defer/sendMonthlyUsage.tsx
+import React from "react";
 import { Resend } from "resend";
+import {
+  Page,
+  Text,
+  View,
+  Document,
+  StyleSheet,
+  renderToBuffer,
+} from "@react-pdf/renderer";
 import MonthlyUsageEmail from "@/emails/MonthlyUsage";

+const styles = StyleSheet.create({
+  // ...
+});
+
+// PDF file listing the executions with associated usage
+const ExecutionsDetail = () => (
+  <Document>
+    <Page size="A4" style={styles.page}>
+      // ...
+    </Page>
+  </Document>
+);
+
 const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!);

 async function sendMonthlyUsage() {
+  const pdf = await renderToBuffer(<ExecutionsDetail />);
+
   const title = `You performed ${new Intl.NumberFormat().format(
    usageInfo.executions
  )} executions in ${billingInfo.period}`;
@@ -19,5 +57,16 @@
       percentPlan: usageInfo.planPercent,
      period: billingInfo.period,
     }),
+    attachments: [
+      {
+        content: pdf,
+        filename: "detail.pdf",
+      },
+    ],
   });
 }

```

<Info>
  Resend accepts an `attachments` option taking an array of files (`Buffer` and
  file's name).

### Transform `sendMonthlyUsage()` into a Background Function

We simply wrap `sendMonthlyUsage()` with
[`defer()`](/references/defer-client/v1/defer) to transform it into a Defer
[Background Function](/get-started/concepts#background-functions):

```diff src/defer/sendMonthlyUsage.tsx
 import { Resend } from "resend";
+import { defer } from "@defer/client";
 import MonthlyUsageEmail from "@/emails/MonthlyUsage";

 const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!);
@@ -21,3 +22,8 @@
     }),
   });
 }
+
+export default defer(sendMonthlyUsage, {
+  concurrency: 10,
+  retry: 5,
+});
```

<Info>
  You'll notice that we pass to `defer()` 2 options:

- a `concurrency: 10` to match Resend's 10 calls/sec policy
- a `retry` strategy to recover potential
  [errors](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/errors)

</Info>

Our `sendMonthlyUsage()` is now ready to be called to schedule emails.

## Scheduling the monthly usage emails

Each customer has a dedicated sliding usage window (e.g.: _From August 15th to
September 16th_).

### Send the usage email on a sliding window schedule

We'll leverage Defer's [`delay()`](/references/defer-client/v1/delay) feature to
match this criteria:

```ts src/app/api/startSubscription/route.ts
import { delay } from "@defer/client";
import sendMonthlyUsage from "@/defer/sendMonthlyUsage";

export const POST = () => {
  const { current_period_end } = // ... create Subscription in Stripe

  const delayedsendMonthlyUsage = delay(sendMonthlyUsage, new Date(current_period_end));
  await delayedsendMonthlyUsage(userId);
}

```

<Info>
  Each call to `sendMonthlyUsage()` from the NextJS App will trigger a
  background execution on **Defer**.
</Info>

We need to update `sendMonthlyUsage()` to reschedule itself for the next billing
period, again by using `delay()` from `@defer/client`:

<Info>
  **What happened here?**

The `sendMonthlyUsage()` became a recursive
[Background Function](/get-started/concepts#background-functions), scheduling
itself for the next usage period. To achieve this, we needed to move
`defer(sendMonthlyUsage)` to the `deferSendMonthlyUsage` variable so we could
pass it to `delay()`.

</Info>

### Handling unsubscribed customers

Customers do churn and we might want to stop sending them usage emails if they
drop in the middle of a billing cycle.

For this, we will leverage
[Defer's cancellations mechanism](/features/cancellation).

First, let's store the Execution ID of a planned monthly usage email, by
updating `sendMonthlyUsage()` as follows:

```diff sendMonthlyUsage.ts
@@ -68,7 +68,9 @@
   });

   const delayedsendMonthlyUsage = delay(deferSendMonthlyUsage, new Date(billingInfo.current_period_end));
-  await delayedsendMonthlyUsage(userId);
+  const { id: nextEmailIdExecutionId } = await delayedsendMonthlyUsage(userId);
+
+  // save `nextEmailIdExecutionId` to the database
 }

 const deferSendMonthlyUsage = defer(sendMonthlyUsage, {
```

Then, let's update our unsubscribe API Routes to cancel any pending monthly
usage email:

```ts src/app/api/cancelSubscription/route.ts
import { cancelExecution } from "@defer/client";
import sendMonthlyUsage from "@/defer/sendMonthlyUsage";

export const POST = () => {
  // ... cancel Subscription in Stripe

  const nextEmailIdExecutionId = // query using `session.userId`
    cancelExecution(nextEmailIdExecutionId);
};
```

## Wrapping up

Our application now provides **rich and personalized monthly usage emails** to
our customers.

The **Defer Console** is your best companion, making it **easy to oversee all
usage emails**:
