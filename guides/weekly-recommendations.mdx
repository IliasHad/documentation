## Introduction

Defer makes it easy to turn a function into a CRON.

In this example, a marketplace wants to send product recommendations to users on
a weekly basis.

For this, we will create a scheduled function (`weeklyProductRecommendations()`)
that performs the following steps:

1. Gather all the users that opt-in for the weekly product recommendation
2. For each user, in parallel:
   - invoke a background function (`computeProductRecommendation(user)`), that
     will compute the product recommendations and send an email

## CRON background function

A background function can be configured to run at a given frequency using
`defer.cron(fn, frequencyStr)`:

```ts defer/weeklyProductRecommendations.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

const weeklyProductRecommendations = async () => {
  // ...
};

export default defer.cron(weeklyProductRecommendations, "0 8 * * *");
```

<Info>CRONs schedule is based on UTC.</Info>

A scheduled background function is similar to a regular background function:

- a scheduled background function **should be async**
- a scheduled background function file **must be named following the function's
  name** and **export as default**

With some specificities:

- a scheduled background function **should not take arguments**
- a scheduled background function **should not be invoked** directly from your
  App (will result in errors)

Let's now see how to implement our product recommendation scheduled function.

## `weeklyProductRecommendations()` scheduled function

Our weekly product recommendation mechanism is implemented with 2 background
functions:

```
- src/
  - defer/
    - weeklyProductRecommendations.ts ⬅
    - computeProductRecommendation.ts ⬅
  - ...
- prisma/
- package.json
- .env
- ...
```

<CodeGroup>

```ts defer/weeklyProductRecommendations.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";
import computeProductRecommendation from "./computeProductRecommendation";

const weeklyProductRecommendations = async () => {
  const users = await prisma.user.find({
    where: {
      weeklyProductRecommendations: true,
    },
  });

  for (let user of users) {
    await computeProductRecommendation(user);
  }
};

export default defer.cron(weeklyProductRecommendations, "0 8 * * *");
```

```ts defer/computeProductRecommendation.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";
import { User } from "../prisma/generated/client";

const computeProductRecommendation = async (user: User) => {
  // 1. compute product recommendations ...
  // 2. send email
};

export default defer(computeProductRecommendation);
```

</CodeGroup>

Which translates to the following executions, on each Monday, at 8am:

</Frame>

By leveraging the Defer background functions, our weekly product recommendation
is:

- **Scalable**: by parallelizing the computation and sending of recommendations,
  the overall time to send the recommendations won't be exponential over time.
- **Reliable**: any error during a product recommendation computing or email
  sending will trigger a Defer Smart Retry.
- **Observable**: get an overview of the status of the reporting from the Defer
  dashboard.
- **Monitored**: get notified on Slack if the app couldn't deliver the product
  recommendation to a user.
