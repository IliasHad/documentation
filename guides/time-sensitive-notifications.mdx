Background executions, such as real-time updating, are central to online
applications. They free up front-end interactions (and users) to continue with
no pause.

However, there are times when you need to cancel a background execution. In this
guide, you'll see how to cancel a process after a short period of time.

## Real-world use cases

- Sending a 2FA code over email when signing in to a web application
- Sending chat notifications of live messages
- Communicating an available slot in the queue of a concert ticket-selling
  platform

In all cases, there's a reason to time out the process: For the 2FA, it's a
security issue; for the live messages, the user has perhaps already received a
notification; for the concert, someone's just bought your ticket.

## How Defers sets a time limit

The code below uses Defer to execute the well-known
“[Sign-in magic link](https://postmarkapp.com/blog/magic-links)” use case.

Slack uses this magical sign-in technique. Instead of asking a user to type a
password, it asks only for the user's email. The user receives an email with a
unique “magic link”, which they click to sign in to the application. Users are
thus not required to remember or type in their passwords.

Useful, but as you can imagine, a magic link can be a security issue. So it's
best to time it out. Here, Defer ensures that this link no longer works after 5
minutes.

### The code

First, wrap the code that sends the email (`sgMail.send`) in the `async`
function `sendSignInEmail()`, which Defer uses to time out the message.

```tsx src/defer/sendSignInEmail.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";
import sgMail from "@sendgrid/mail";

import { getMagicMailFromUser } from "./lib/user";

async function sendSignInEmail(email: string) {
  await sgMail.send(getMagicMailFromUser(email));
}

export default defer(sendSignInEmail, {
  retry: false, // It is important to disable the retries
});
```

Second, set up Defer's
[`discardAfter()`](https://docs.defer.run/features/discard) helper, which allows
you to cancel the background execution. In this case, Defer will cancel the
above `sendSignInEmail` after 5 min.

```tsx src/api.ts
import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";
import { discardAfter } from "@defer/client";

import sendSignInEmail from "./defer/sendSignInEmail";

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

// discard any `sendSignInEmail()` execution if not
//  sent in the next 5 minutes after being requested
const sendExpirableSignInEmail = discardAfter(sendSignInEmail, "5min");

app.post("/sign-in", async function (req, res) {
  const email = req.params.email;

  await sendExpirableSignInEmail(email);

  res.render("sign-in_email_sent", { email });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Being able to _cancel a job_ plays an important role in managing your background
executions. So too with _rescheduling a job,_ which Defer provides with its
[`reschedule()`](https://docs.defer.run/features/reschedule) option. You may
also want to look up Defer's
[`addMetadata()`](https://docs.defer.run/features/metadata) helper. With
[Metadata](/features/metadata), you can add conditions to control the flow of
your background jobs.
