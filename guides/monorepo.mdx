title: "Setup Defer with a monorepo"
description: "Use Turborepo, NPM, Yarn & PNPM workspaces with Defer"
---

In this guide we will show you how to:

- Use defer inside a monorepo
- Use another package inside a background function
- Call your background function from another package
- Deploy your background function on Defer
- Understand the Defer build process

<Note>
  To illustrate this guide with code examples, a new project has been initiated
  with:

```bash
  pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest
```

You don't have to use Turborepo or pnpm to follow this guide though.

</Note>

## 1. Identifying your workspaces

If you already have a monorepo setup, you can skip to
[2. Create a defer folder](/guides/monorepo#2-create-a-defer-folder).

Monorepos use workspaces to keep track of the different your different projects
or apps. Depending on which package manager you are using, defining workspaces
is done differently.

Here is an overview of the definitions of pnpm, npm & yarn workspaces in our
example:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml pnpm workspaces - pnpm-workspace.yaml
packages:
  - "apps/*"
  - "packages/*"
```

```json npm / yarn workspaces - package.json
"workspaces": [
  "apps/*",
  "packages/*"
],
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Create a defer folder

The Defer platform uses the `defer/` folder to autodetect your background
functions.

<Warning>
  Defer does not yet support multiple `defer/` folders per Defer environment.
</Warning>

As a result, you should only use one `defer/` folder accross your monorepo.

Here are our recommendations on where this folder should be located:

- If you will only use defer with one of your workspaces, you might want to add
  it to this workspace.
- Alternatively, if you'd like to keep things separated and plan on using Defer
  with multiple workspaces, you can also add it in a dedicated workspace.

Please take a look at the monorepo structures below for reference:

<CodeGroup>

```diff Existing workspace
 .
 +-- README.md
 +-- apps
 |   +-- docs/
 |   `-- web
 |       +-- README.md
 |       +-- app/
+|       +-- defer
+|           `-- helloWorld.ts
 |       +-- next-env.d.ts
 |       +-- next.config.js
 |       +-- package.json
 |       +-- public
 |       `-- tsconfig.json
 +-- package.json
 +-- packages
 |   +-- eslint-config-custom/
 |   +-- tsconfig/
 |   `-- ui/
 +-- pnpm-lock.yaml
 +-- pnpm-workspace.yaml
 +-- tsconfig.json
 `-- turbo.json
```

```diff New workspace
 .
 +-- README.md
 +-- apps
 |   +-- docs/
 |   +-- web/
 +-- package.json
 +-- packages
+|   +-- defer
+|       +-- helloWorld.ts
+|       `-- package.json
 |   +-- eslint-config-custom/
 |   +-- tsconfig/
 |   `-- ui/
 +-- pnpm-lock.yaml
 +-- pnpm-workspace.yaml
 +-- tsconfig.json
 `-- turbo.json
```

```json New workspace - packages/defer/package.json
{
  "name": "defer",
  "private": true
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. Install the @defer/client

The Defer client is used to communicate with the Defer API. You will need it to
execute your background functions on the Defer Platform.

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
# existing 'web' workspace
pnpm install @defer/client --filter web
# new 'defer' workspace
pnpm install @defer/client --filter defer
```

```bash npm
# existing 'web' workspace
npm install @defer/client -w apps/web
# new 'defer' workspace
npm install @defer/client -w packages/defer
```

```bash yarn
# existing 'web' workspace
yarn workspace apps/web add @defer/client
# new 'defer' workspace
yarn workspace packages/defer add @defer/client
```

</CodeGroup>

## 4. Write an `greet` background function

Before writing complex business logic, let's write a simple background function.

```ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

const greet: (name) => Promise<any> = async (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
};

export default defer(greet);
```

## 5. Call your background function

You can use your background function from anywhere in your code.

Here is an example on how you can call it in

<CodeGroup>

```ts Existing workspace - apps/web/app/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import greet from "../defer/greet";

export async function POST() {
  // calling a background function triggers an execution on Defer Platform
  const res = await greet("John Doe");
  const data = await res.json();

  return NextResponse.json({ data });
}
```

```ts Existing workspace - apps/web/app/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import greet from "defer/greet";

export async function POST() {
  // calling a background function triggers an execution on Defer Platform
  const res = await greet("John Doe");
  const data = await res.json();

  return NextResponse.json({ data });
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## 6. Configure & Deploy a Defer environment

Head up to our [quickstart](/get-started/quickstart/nextjs#configure) section to
follow the instructions on how to configure your defer environment on the Defer
Console.

<Note>
  You don't need to run `turbo build` to deploy your application on defer.

You only need to push to [Github](https://github.com/) to make your background
functions available to the Defer Platorm.

The Defer Builder builds your background functions for you, and is tailored to
optimize the bundle to only contain those and their dependencies.

</Note>

That's it, you are now fully set up to leverage background functions inside your
Turborepo! ðŸŽ‰
