Our workers are in charge of hosting our Runner containers.

## Architecture

The Runner containers are hosted on an **x64** architecure. **ARM** is not
supported. All native dependencies must be compatible with **x64**.

## Runner Types

Our Runners are **Docker** containers. We keep our docker daemon and client up
to date.

## Operating System

The operating system of our Runner containers is `Ubuntu 20.04`.

## Operating regions

We operate in the following regions:

- `us-1` (Ohio)
- `eu-1` (Ireland)

## IP addresses

Our Runners use the following IP adresses:

| region | IP addresses                                                                       |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| us-1   | <ul><li>`3.130.124.175`</li><li>`3.140.205.180`</li><li>`18.218.151.156`</li></ul> |
