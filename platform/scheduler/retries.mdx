title: "Retries"
---

The Scheduler orchestrates retries with the following parameters:

- `maxAttempts`: How many retries should we attempt in total.
- `initialInterval`: How close the first retry should be? (in seconds).
- `randomizationFactor`: How much randomness should be introduced in the space
  between retries.
- `multiplier`: How fast the space between each retry should grow? (exponential
  back-off).
- `maxInterval`: What should be the max space between 2 retries? (in seconds).
