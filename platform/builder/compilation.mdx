title: "Compilation"
---

The Builder uses the [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) JS API to compile and
bundle your background functions.

## Entrypoints

Each file in your `defer` folder should export a Defer background function as
its `default` export.

Here are the requirements for those files:

- `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.cjs`, `.cjsx`, `.cts`, `.ctsx`, `.mjs`,
  `.mjsx`, `.mts`, `.mtsx` extensions are supported
- `*.spec.*`, `*.test.*`, `*_spec.*`, `*_test.*` files are ignored
- `spec`, `test`, `specs`, `tests` nested folders are skipped

## Typescript

Version `4.x` and `5.x` are supported.

The Builder detects your version of TS and uses it to compile your background
functions.

<Note>
  TS errors will only result in warnings (as per the TS compiler default
  `noEmitOnError`)
</Note>

## Supported files

- `.json`
- `.jsx`
- `.md`
- `.txt`
- `.html`
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.svg`, etc

## Bundles and Sourcemaps

Here are the characteristics of the output of the Builder:

- One bundle per function
- Tree shaking is performed to reduce bundle size
- Bundles are emitted under the **commonJS** format
- Sourcemaps are generated
