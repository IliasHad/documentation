title: "Dependencies Installation"
---

The Builder installs your project dependencies using the detected package
manager.

## Lockfile

Dependencies are **installed with the exact versions found in the lockfile**.

Here are the commands executed, depending on the detected package manager:

| Package Manager | Command                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **NPM**         | `npm ci --no-audit`                                 |
| **Yarn**        | `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`                    |
| **PNPM**        | `pnpm install --shamefully-hoist --frozen-lockfile` |
| **Bun**         | `bun install --frozen-lockfile`                     |

## Custom installation

You cannot customize the above commands, but you can still customize the
installation of your dependencies. Indeed, you can use an `.npmrc` file or
`NPM_CONFIG_` prefixed env variables to customize your package manager behavior.

Example:

To ignore peer dependencies like in npm v3 to v6, you can either:

- add `legacy-peer-deps=true` to your `.npmrc` file
- set the `NPM_CONFIG_LEGACY_PEER_DEPS` env variable to `"true"`

## Private dependencies

The Builder supports installing private packages. To do so, you need to create
an access token:

```
npm token create --read-only
```

Then, store this token in your environment variable, say `NPM_TOKEN`

Finally, add the following to a new or existing `.npmrc` file:

```
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

## Native dependencies

The Builder supports native dependencies to an extent.

- Node builtin native dependencies are supported
- Node native addons (`.node` files) built using **node-gyp** and/or
  **node-pre-gyp** should also work out of the box

Some native addons won't work out of the box with our Builder, e.g. when the
code reads some file at runtime.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of native dependencies known to work with our
Builder:

- [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg)
- [prisma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma)
- [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)
- [vm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vm2)
- [canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas)
- [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp)
